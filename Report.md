What I learned
Today I started learning git and github. In the past year I have been using git, but I never really had the chance to really understand it. Therefore I would say I am pretty much new to it.
The first thing I started out learning was not the commands, but instead about git itself. Git was created Linus, the creator of the Linux system. He initially used BitMover as a version control system for Linux, but as BitMover decided to not provide any more service for Linux, Linus himself made a version control system which became git. Git, unlike the older version control systems, is a distributed system. The old systems were concentrated systems, where everything was stored inside one server. It was really painful for users since they had to upload all their files every time they wanted to commit a version, and also if the server dies, then everyone dies. On the other hand, in a distributed system, every user has his own version storage in his own computer, no more uploading was needed and it became possible to copy the file from one's coworkers if his computer broke. So git immediately became popular.
After knowing about git I started making a repository as I already have git installed. I used the ```git init```command to make the repository and used the ```ls -ah``` command to check the .git file (the repository) was made. Something interesting I noticed was that images, videos and word type files cannot be version controlled by git as they are binary coded. After creating some files, I was able to use ```git status``` to tell whether files have been saved to the repository, which obviously haven't. So I used the ```git add file``` command to add it to the stage, then ```git commit -m "message"``` to commit it and move the version from the stage to the master. After that I was able to use ```git diff file``` to see what I have changed in some of the files since the last commit.
Then I learned about "moving back in time", which is restoring to a previous version. ```git reset --hard commitId``` is the command needed to do so, but first I needed to find the commit id of the version I want to return to. To do this I used the ```git log``` command, which would show me the history of commits and their commit id. I could also use ```HEAD``` as the commit id, it is a pointer to the current master, and so if I want to return to the last version I committed I could use ```HEAD^``` and then ```HEAD^^``` for the next last and so on. If I accidentally to an earlier version, then the log command would no longer be helpful. I could use ```git relog``` to see the history of the commands I entered and their id to help me "return to the future".
The structure of git also caught my eye. First the folder that contains the .git folder is called the working directory and the .git folder is the repository. Inside the repository, there are two most important part which are the stage and the master. When I add a file to the repository, it first goes into the stage which acts like a temporary storage for the version. Then when I commit, git moves everything in the stage into the master, making a new version. Interestingly, git does not save the versions by the files, but instead by the changes, and all the versions, in fact, all exist at the same time just with the ```HEAD``` pointing to what we want to be the master. That is why restoring versions in git is so fast.
I also learned that the ```git checkout -- file``` command restores the version of the working directory back the the one in the stage, this works even if you deleted some files, and also that ```git reset HEAD file``` restores the version of the stage back to the one in the master.
So I then started learning about github. I first needed a ssh key to do so which I already have, But if I didn't have it then I would need to use the ```ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "myEmail@email.com"``` to generate a key in the .ssh file in my user folder. The .pub file in the .ssh folder contains the public key that I would need to use github. Then I created a repository in github and linked it with my local repository following the instructions on github. Then I used the ```git push -u origin master``` command to push my files in the local repository to the github repository and link them. After that, I would only need to use ```git push origin master``` to push. Then if next time I lost my local repository, I could use the ```git clone git@server-name:path/repo-name.git``` command to clone a local repository from the github one.
This is all I learned today.
