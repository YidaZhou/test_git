- 
- if both sides have iterators then we can have many variables assigned at the same time, this is called destruction. eg. `let [a,b,c] = [1,2,3];`, interestingly you can even assign value with an generator function: 
````javascript
let gen = function () {
  while(true){
  yield 1;
  }
}
let [a, b, c] = gen();
````
- you can have default values for destruction `let [a, b=1] = [1];`
- destruction works with objects too, but uses prop name to get value. If you want to name it differently, then use the structure `propName: varName`. eg. `let {sex:s,name:n}={sex:'M',name:'Yida'};`. 
- works with multiple layers:  
````javascript
let obj = {
  p: ['Hello',{ y: 'World' }]
};
let { p: [x, { y }] } = obj;
````
note that `p` is not assigned as it acts like a mode, will need `let { p, p: [x, { y }] } = obj;` to assign `p`. Only the inner most vars get the values and if the outer one (mode) doesn't exist, there would be an error.  
- add `(..)` around when just assigning by destruction.  
- can use object on left to assign with array on right with destruction. In this case, the index is the key of props. Strings also act just like arrays.  
- only when using destruction to assign but not declare, you can use `(..)`, and cannot use it on modes.  
- `[a, b]=[b,a];` works.  
- we can call function without having param in right order: eg. 
````javascript
function f({x, y, z}) { ... }
f({z: 3, y: 2, x: 1});
````
  
- adding `{..}` when unicode will now always get you the correct value. eg. '\u{1F680}' would be turned into '\uD83D\uDE80'. 
- characters with more than 2 bytes will need `codePointAt()` method to get code while one less than 2 can be done with `charCodeAt()` method.  
- use `toString()` method to change from decimal to hexadecimal.  

- the u flag (eg. /\d/u) os used to make the RegExp support Unicode. 
- the `.` symbol means 'any character but change line', and it must have the u flag to recognize unicode characters.  
- add `{..}` to represent unicode characters in regexp, but must have u flag.  
- `\S` means everything but space, and it must have the u flag to recognize unicode characters.  
- regexp now have `unicode` (no brackets) prop to return whether has u flag.  
- y flag is just like g flag, but it it looks for 'right after' instead of 'after', and has to start from the beginning. 
- `match()` method with just y flag will only return match, has to be with g flag to return all.  
- g flag ignores illegal characters while y flag wouldn't.  
- now have `sticky` prop to return whether has y flag.  
- regexp now have `flag` prop to return all the flags.  
- s flag makes `.`include all (with line changes).  
- `dotAll` prop to return whether has s flag.  
- `/x(?=y)/` for all x before y, `/x(?!y)/` for all x not before y. Now js also has `/(?<=y)x/` for all x after y and `/(?<!y)x/` for all x not after y, these match from right to left so due to greedy algorithms, the result will be different.  
- now you can call a unicode prop with `\p{UnicodePropertyName=UnicodePropertyValue}`. For example `/\p{Script=Greek}/u`, and with P instead of p, it will match the characters that don't comply.  
- now ES6 has named capture groups:
````javascript
const RE_DATE = /(?<year>\d{4})-(?<month>\d{2})-(?<day>\d{2})/;
const matchObj = RE_DATE.exec('1999-12-31');
const year = matchObj.groups.year; // 1999
const month = matchObj.groups.month; // 12
const day = matchObj.groups.day; // 31
````
- can use such names for destruction: `let {groups: {one, two}} = /^(?<one>.*):(?<two>.*)$/u.exec('foo:bar');` or can be used in `replace` method: 
````javascript
let re = /(?<year>\d{4})-(?<month>\d{2})-(?<day>\d{2})/u;
'2015-01-02'.replace(re, '$<day>/$<month>/$<year>')
````
- `\k<name>` to use the named capture group in the same regexp.  
- `String.prototype.matchAll()` is a new method that will return a those that match as an iterator. To change that iterator into an array, use `[...string.matchAll(regex)]` or `Array.from(string.matchAll(regex));` 

- binary and octal values now use the prefixes `0b` and `0o`.  
- `Number()` function could turn them into decimal values.  
- `Number` object now has the two new methods `Number.isFinite()` and `Number.isNaN()`.  
- `parseInt()` and `parseFloat()` are now also methods of `Number`.  
- `Number.isInteger()`  
- `Number.EPSILON` is a prop with the value 2 to the power -52. 
- `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` and `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` are the limits of `Number`.  
- `Math.trunc()` method removes the decimals of a number, it also uses `parseInt()` within.  
- `Math.sign()` check the sign of the number and returns: +1 for positive, -1 for negative, 0 for 0 and -0 for -0. It also converts param to number within. If not have it, use: 
````javascript
  x = +x; // convert to a number
  if (x === 0 || isNaN(x)) {
    return x;
  }
  return x > 0 ? 1 : -1;
````
- `Math.cbrt()` to find a numbers cube root, and uses `Number()` within to convert param to number.  
- `Math.clz32()`, clz32 means "count leading zero bits in 32-bit binary representation of a number". It will only care about the integer part of number.  
- `Math.imul()` could multiply more accurately and can use 32-bit values in it.  
- `Math.hypot()` return the sqrt of the sum of the square of all the params.  
- `Math.log10()`, `Math.log2()`
- adding h after the sin of cos functions (eg. Math.tanh(x)) makes it a function about the hyperbolic curve.  
- `number ** power`, (eg. 2**3=2*2*2=8). 
- `b**=3` would mean b = b*b*b

- when setting default values for params of functions, then we should always have the ones with default values at the end.  
- `function` type has prop `length` the returns the number of params that don't have default values.  
- something interesting is
````javascript
var x = 1;
function foo(x, y = function() { x = 2; }) {
  var x = 3;
  y();
  console.log(x);
}
foo() // 3
x // 1
````
but
````javascript
var x = 1;
function foo(x, y = function() { x = 2; }) {
  x = 3;
  y();
  console.log(x);
}
foo() // 2
x // 1
````
- (param1, param2, ...pramas), this way prams will be an array of the rest of the parameters passed into a function, and the `length` prop will not count it.  
- don't use `'use strict'` within functions that use ES6 features.  
- `function` type has prop `name` that will return the name of the function. In ES6, the name of an anonymous function is the name of the variable assigned to it.  
- arrow functions cannot be used as generators.  
- `this` in an arrow function is the object it is in when it is declared, not when it is used.  
- arrow function could also make lambda calculations easier: 
````javascript
// λ演算的写法
fix = λf.(λx.f(λv.x(x)(v)))(λx.f(λv.x(x)(v)))
// ES6的写法
var fix = f => (x => f(v => x(x)(v)))
               (x => f(v => x(x)(v)));
````
- `foo::bar;` equals `bar.bind(foo);`, and `foo::bar(...args)` equals `bar.apply(foo, args);`  
- using tail call (returning only one function at the end) then it will save a lot of memory, especially when using recursion. eg.
````javascript
function Fibonacci (n) {
  if ( n <= 1 ) {return 1};
  return Fibonacci(n - 1) + Fibonacci(n - 2);
}
Fibonacci(10) // 89
Fibonacci(100) // 堆栈溢出
Fibonacci(500) // 堆栈溢出
````
to 
````javascript
function Fibonacci2 (n , ac1 = 1 , ac2 = 1) {
  if( n <= 1 ) {return ac2};
  return Fibonacci2 (n - 1, ac2, ac1 + ac2);
}
Fibonacci2(100) // 573147844013817200000
Fibonacci2(1000) // 7.0330367711422765e+208
Fibonacci2(10000) // Infinity
````
- a good example of tail calling in ES6:
````javascript
function factorial(n, total = 1) {
  if (n === 1) return total;
  return factorial(n - 1, n * total);
}

factorial(5) // 120
````
  
- `...` before an array makes the array single elements separated by `,`, eg. [1, ...[2, 3], 4] equals [1, 2, 3, 4].  
- no longer need `apply()` like `f.apply(null, args);` but instead `f(...args);` for an array of arguments.  
- to copy an array `a2 = [...a1];`   
- combine arrays `[...arr1, ...arr2];` but these (and the method above) will change if the original changes. Use `concat` to make ones independent. 
- string into array `[...'hello'];`  
- iterator to array `[...iterator];`  
- `Array.from()` turns an array-like object or an iterator into an array. eg. 
````javascript
let arrayLike = {
    '0': 'a',
    '1': 'b',
    '2': 'c',
    length: 3
};
let arr2 = Array.from(arrayLike); // ['a', 'b', 'c']
````
it can also have a second param, a function to apply to every element. 
- `Array.of()` turns the params into an array. 
- `Array.prototype.copyWithin(target, start = 0, end = this.length)`
````javascript
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].copyWithin(0, 3)
// [4, 5, 3, 4, 5]
````
- `arr.find(fun())` get the first element that returns true of the function, `arr.findIndex()` get the index of it.  
- `arr.fill(elem, start, end)` from the start element right up to the end element (not include it), fill with elem.  
- `arr.keys()`, `arr.values()`, `arr.entries()` returns iterators of the functions' keys, values, and key-value pairs.  
- `arr.includes(elem, startingFrom)`
- similarly, `Map` has `has(key)`, and `Set` has `has(value)` methods.  
- empty elements in arrays are not treated as `undefined`.  

- add `*` before generator functions as methods.  
- add `[..]`around prop name to use a statement as a prop name. Then no `.` is needed when calling.  
- `Object.is(obj1, obj2)` act like `obj1===obj2`, the difference is `Object.is(NaN, NaN)` is true and `Object.is(+0, -0)` is false.  
- `Object.assign(target, source, source, ...)` take all the props from all the sources and copy them to the target. It will cover the original props in same name, and the sources after would copy the ones before. Sources with no props will be ignored. Methods themselves won't be copied if they can directly get a value, the value would be copied.  
- There are functions that will ignore props with their `enumerable` as `false` in their descriptor. These are:  
  - for..in
  - Object.keys()
  - JSON.stringify()
  - Object.assign()
- `Reflect.ownKeys(obj)` would return an array of all the keys of an object with the `Symbol()` at the end.  
- `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(obj)` method would get all the descriptors of all the props (including methods) within it.  
- use the above method to merge:  
````javascript
const shallowMerge = (target, source) => Object.defineProperties(
  target,
  Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(source)
);
````
- `Object.setPrototypeOf(object, prototype)`
- `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);`
- use `super` like `this` to point to the prototype, but it should only exist in the methods.  
- `Object.keys(obj)`, `Object.values(obj)`, `Object.entries(obj)`, return an array of only the enumerable props.  
- copy object using destruction: 
````javascript
let obj = { a: { b: 1 } };
let { ...x } = obj;
````  
or
````javascript
let z = { a: 3, b: 4 };
let n = { ...z };
n // { a: 3, b: 4 }
````

- `Symbol('Description')` makes a symbol with a string description.  
- symbols can be shown as strings, eg. `String(Symbol('Hello'))`.  
- symbols must be treated as expressions to use as key of props in objects. (be in `[..]`)  
- props declared with symbols can only be returned by `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(obj)` method, and the new method `Reflect.ownKeys(obj)`
- `Symbol.for('des')` looks for the symbol with the same description and links to it, if doesn't exist then makes new, it will also register the symbol.  
- `Symbol.keyFor(symbol)` returns the key value of a registered symbol.  
- every module is an type, so we need to make an instance of it to the global so that every time the same instance is called, eg. 
````javascript
const FOO_KEY = Symbol.for('foo');
function A() {
  this.foo = 'hello';
}
if (!global[FOO_KEY]) {
  global[FOO_KEY] = new A();
}
module.exports = global[FOO_KEY];
````
using the symbol as a key makes it impossible for outer modules to change this file.  
- js has some symbols with special functions:  
  - `[Symbol.hasInstance]` of an obj point to a method and when `a instanceof obj`, this method is called.  
  - `[Symbol.isConcatSpreadable]` is a bool about whether the obj is speadable when using the `concat()` method of arrays.  
  - `[Symbol.species]` is a prop used when an obj that extends this one is used.  
  - `[Symbol.match]`, when using `str.match(myObject)` this symbol would be used.  
  - `[Symbol.replace]`, used when the `String.prototype.replace` method is used.  
  - `[Symbol.search]` used when the `String.prototype.search` method is used.  
  - `[Symbol.split]` used when the `String.prototype.split` method is used. 
  - `[Symbol.iterator]` points to the default iterator of the obj.  
  - `[Symbol.toPrimitive]` points to the method of converting to primitive types.  
  - `[Symbol.toStringTag]` used when the `Object.prototype.toString` method is used and will be in the string returned to show the type.  
  - `[Symbol.unscopables]`, tells what props will be ignored when using `with`.
