ES6
-
- babel changes ES6 style code into ES5 style. Search for how to make .babelrc file use it. To translate online: https://babeljs.io/repl/. 
- `let` will not 'lift' the declaration.  
- if a variable is declared by `const` or `let` in a block, then it becomes binded to the block, no longer affected by anything outside. It will also have a TDZ as once entering the zone, the variable will exist, but is not accessible until it is declared.  
- let cannot redeclare variables, including with ones from the params.  
- use `{..}` to define blocks. Then variables within the block will not affect ones out of it.  
- never declare functions in block, if need then at least use `let fun = function() {..};`
- `const` will only be available in the block it is declared, like `let` and it has TDZ problem.  
- `const` is that the pointer is always constant, but the things in the address are changeable, so we can add props to an `const` object, or push elements to a `const` array. 
- `Object.freeze(obj)` to really freeze and object. Here is an example of freezing everything of an object:  
````javascript
var constantize = (obj) => {
  Object.freeze(obj);
  Object.keys(obj).forEach( (key, i) => {
    if ( typeof obj[key] === 'object' ) {
      constantize( obj[key] );
    }
  });
};
````
- global variables declared by type `let` `const` or `class` are no longer part of the `window` or `global`.  
- a way to get the out most object (eg. `window`) is: 
````javascript
var getGlobal = function () {
  if (typeof self !== 'undefined') { return self; }
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { return window; }
  if (typeof global !== 'undefined') { return global; }
  throw new Error('unable to locate global object');
};
