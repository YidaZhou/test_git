function
-
Js has many higher order functions, which are functions that take another function as a parameter. One of such functions is the `map()` function of the `Array` type. `arr.map(fun)` returns a new array with the elements all passed into fun and replaced with their results. Besides from that, the `Array` type also has many other higher order functions listed below:
- `arr.reduce(fun(x,y){..})` takes in a function that needs two parameters and then applies it on the elements pair by pair in turn to end up with one single result.  
- `arr.filter(fun)` takes a function that returns a bool, and returns new array with only the elements that return true. This `fun` can have 1 or 3 params, if 3, then it is `(element, index, self)` where `self` means the array.  
- `arr.sort()` is also a higher order method. It works without a function but if so then it uses the ASCII code to compare and treats numbers as strings to compare. The correct way to use it is: 
````
arr.sort(function (x, y) {
    if (x < y) {
        return -1;
    }
    if (x > y) {
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
});
````
the difference between `sort()` and the other methods is that it doesn't return a new array but instead changes the original one. Also to notice, if we want to compare strings then we should add 
````
x = x.toUpperCase();
y = y.toUpperCase();
````
to the top of the function.  
Js has special feature called enclosure, that is, if function A in function B, function B can `return A` and A will not be calculated until it is used. A should never include any loop variable or or changing variable, if really need so, do something like this:
````
function count() {
    var arr = [];
    for (var i=1; i<=3; i++) {
        arr.push((function (n) {
            return function () {
                return n * n;
            }
        })(i));
    }
    return arr;
}
```` 
this way, the most inner function would save the value of n for each iteration, or else by the time it is calculated, they would all become 4. Such enclosure method could be really good to create the 'private' feature of classes for the functions. It is also capable of making functions with multiple params into functions that use less, for example: 
````
function make_pow(n) {
    return function (x) {
        return Math.pow(x, n);
    }
}
var pow2 = make_pow(2);
var pow3 = make_pow(3);
console.log(pow2(5)); // 25
console.log(pow3(7)); // 343
````  
It is not hard to notice that above, there was an anonymous function. Yes, js has anonymous functions that can be written in the syntax `(function(param) {..})(Param)` . Besides from anonymous functions, js also has arrow functions that act like anonymous functions. eg `x => x*x;` or `x=> {..}` or even `(x, y)=>{..}`. Note that if there is only one statement, then don't add `{ }` or there would be an error. The biggest difference between arrow and other functions, is the `this` problem. While using arrow function in a method `this` doesn't need to be saved and can be used directly, but at the same time, it would not be possible to use the `call()` or `apply()` function to change the prop pointed by `this`.  
Interestingly, Js also has generator functions declared by `function*`, it can use `yield` instead of `return`. When the generation is called, it only forms the generator but not the value. `Generator.next()` would give the first value of the yield and pause the calculation, then repeat and it would get the next yield and so on.  

objects
-
In js, everything has a type, using `typeof` would return the type of them (eg. `typeof '12';`). It is to notice that when using `new` to declare a variable, it becomes of type `object` (eg. `typeof new Number(123); //'object'`) , so it's best to not use them to declare primitive type variables. Another thing about `typeof` is that it cannot see the type of an array, the only way to check if an object is an array, is by using `Array.isArray(arr)`. Similar related notes are listed below:  
- use `Variable === null` to see if is null.  
- use `typeof Variable === 'undefined'` to see if variable exists.  
- use `typeof window.Variable === 'undefined'` to see if variable is global.  
A special little note: all objects but null and undefined have `toString` method, but for a number to string, it must be written as `(123).toString();` ,it is very important to add the `(..)`.  
Js has a specific type made for time, called `Date`. Here are some ways to use it (if you declared by  `var now = new Date()`):  
- js has the `Date` object to show time (eg. `var now = new Date()`):  
- `now` is the time now. 
- `now.getFullYear()`  
- `now.getMonth()` starts from 0 to 11.  
- `now.getDate()` the nth of this month.  
- `now.getDay()` eg Monday.  
- `now.getHours()`
- `now.getMinutes()`
- `now.getSeconds()`
- `now.getMilliseconds()`
- `now.getTime()` the number of milliseconds since 1970 Jan 1st 0 o clock (or called a timestamp). `Date.now()` is also a way to get the timestamp. Mentioning about timestamps, it is good to know that as long as we pass a timestamp, then we don't need to worry about the time gap.  
  
There are two ways to create a date type variable: 
either
````
var d = new Date(2015, 5, 19, 20, 15, 30, 123);
d; // Fri Jun 19 2015 20:15:30 GMT+0800 (CST)
````
or
````
var d = Date.parse('2015-06-24T19:49:22.875+08:00'); //using ISO 8601 style
d; // 1435146562875, this is a timestamp
````
Js has a very cool ways of recognizing certain patterns in strings called the RegExp. To learn RegExp, we first need to know some signs:  
  - `\d` means numbers.  
  - `\w` word or number  
  - `*` mean any number of  
  - `+` at least one  
  - `?` 1 or 0  
  - `{n}` n number of  
  - `{a, b}` any number of between a and b  
  - `a-z`  
  - `A-Z`  
  - `0-9`  
  - `\Sign` would make the sign available, eg. `\_`  
  - `[..]` to box them, eg. `[0-9a-zA-Z\_]+`  
  - `^` stands for the start
  - `$` stands for the end
  - `A|B` A or B
  
To create an RegExp type variable, the best way to do so is to `var reg = /../`. Another way to do so is to use `var reg = new RegExp('..')`, but every time you need \, you will need to enter \\ due to the string issues.  
Starting to use such variables to test, the RegExp type has an method `test()` to do so. One example of using it would be:  
````
var reg = /\d\w\w/;
reg.test('3dm'); //true
````  
RegExp variables would also be very good to use in the `split()` method of strings. An example of doing so would be `'a,b;; c d'.split(/[\s\,\;]+/); // ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`.  
Another important feature of RegExp is about extracting, when you add `(..)` around some parts of a RegExp variable, then when you use the`exec(string)`method, you get an array of the parts extracted from the string. Here is an example:  
````
var re = /^(\d{3})-(\d{3,8})$/;
re.exec('010-12345'); // ['010-12345', '010', '12345']
````
An important fact about this extraction method is that is uses greedy method, so for example `(\d+)` will get as many numbers as it can, but if you add `?`as `(\d+?)` it will get just enough to go on.  
If you want to get all the substrings that match the RegExp in the long string, then you can add `g` after expreg by `/\d/g` or `new RegExp('\\d', 'g')` would make it global and by calling the `exec()` method over and over, you get the parts available one by one. It may not seem obvious about what I am saying, so look at this example:  
````
var s = 'JavaScript, VBScript, JScript and ECMAScript';
var re=/[a-zA-Z]+Script/g;
re.exec(s); // ['JavaScript']
re.lastIndex; // 10
re.exec(s); // ['VBScript']
re.lastIndex; // 20
re.exec(s); // ['JScript']
re.lastIndex; // 29
re.exec(s); // ['ECMAScript']
re.lastIndex; // 44
re.exec(s); // null
````
When messages are passed around the internet in js, they are passed as JSON strings. The rule is that strings and keys in objects must be in `".."`, so we can use  `JSON.stringify(Object)`  or  `JSON.stringify(Object, null, ' ');`  to make an object into a json version object. The second param could be an array of the props you want (null for all) or a function you want to apply to all props. However, this is not quite controllable, so if we want better control over what comes out of stringify we can also use a `toJSON` method within the object. Here is an example:  
````
var xiaoming = {
    name: 'XM',
    age: 14,
    gender: true,
    height: 1.65,
    toJSON: function () {
        return {
            'Name': this.name,
            'Age': this.age
        };
    }
};
JSON.stringify(xiaoming); // '{"Name":"XM","Age":14}'
````
Another JSON related method is `JSON.parse()`. `JSON.parse` would make a json string back into a js object. For example: `JSON.parse('true'); // true`or `JSON.parse('{"name":"小明","age":14}'); // Object {name: '小明', age: 14}`. -   `JSON.parse`  could also take in a function as a second param to analyze the data gotten, like a function to map `toUpperCase()` to all strings or so.  

object oriented programming
-
Something I found weird was that js uses prototype instead of classes for OOP (which I later found was a lie). A prototype is an object. We can use  `var obj = Object.create(prototype)`  to create a copy of the prototype and later modify the props within it. Then  `obj.__proto__=== prototype`  would be true, meaning that obj created has prototype as its Prototype. As shown, we can use `obj.__proto__` to acces the prototype of an object.  
A better way is to create an object with a constructor method named with the prototype. Example (here the prototype is Student): 
````
function Student(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.hello = function () {
        alert('Hello, ' + this.name + '!');
    }
}
````
then use `new` to make and object with the Student prototype:  
````
var xiaoming = new Student('小明');
````   
Since it is created with a `new`, this constructor function will automatically return `this` pointing at the new student created. Then their relation would be:  
````
xiaoming.constructor === Student.prototype.constructor; // true
Student.prototype.constructor === Student; // true
Object.getPrototypeOf(xiaoming) === Student.prototype; // true
xiaoming instanceof Student; // true
````  
After creating multiple instances of a prototype, it is important to move the props they have in common to their prototype to save memory. 
````
Student.prototype.hello = function () {
    alert('Hello, ' + this.name + '!');
};
````   
Using the constructor function, we need to use `new` every time or else there would be an error. A good way to remove all the worries is to have a function do it for us: 
````
function Student(props) {
    this.name = props.name || '匿名'; // default to'匿名'
    this.grade = props.grade || 1; // default to 1
}
function createStudent(props) {
    return new Student(props || {})
}
````  
so then we can also add any and as many props as we want: eg.  
````
var xiaoming = createStudent({
    name: '小明'
});
````
If we want to make a prototype that has a parent which is another prototype, we could do something like this:  
````
function PrimaryStudent(props) {
    // use the Student's constructor function on 'this'
    Student.call(this, props);
    this.grade = props.grade || 1;
}
````  
and we can make a `inherits` function to make `Student` the prototype of `PrimaryStudents`, notice we need an empty function to be in between:  
````
function inherits(Child, Parent) {
    var F = function () {};
    F.prototype = Parent.prototype;
    Child.prototype = new F();
    Child.prototype.constructor = Child;
}
````  
then we can again add props to `PrimaryStudents`:  
````
PrimaryStudent.prototype.getGrade = function () {
    return this.grade;
};
````
The reason I said that this is all a lie above, is that we could also use the java style class in js (even though it will only work on the newer browsers). If we want to write the `PrimaryStudent` above in class style: 
````
class PrimaryStudent extends Student {
    constructor(name, grade) {
        super(name); // use super to get constructor method from parent
        this.grade = grade;
    }
    myGrade() {
        alert('I am at grade ' + this.grade);
    }
}
````
