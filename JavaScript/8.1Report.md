errors  
-  
The first part I started learning today was the part about errors. This part together wasn't too difficult for me as I have learned similar techniques about java in school. So I first started out with the try{..} catch {..} finally{..} method of error processing. There was no problems with it, but when it came to asynchronous codes, it was a bit hard to understand. I did understand what was the problem with it, just can't really come up of ideas of how to solve it. Even after I saw some solutions, I couldn't really understand why they can solve the situation.  
  
node.js
-
The first part of the node.js was about installing, I had node.js already installed in my system. The explanation of building the environment and the work space in words didn't make much sense to me, but there was a video that showed me clearly what I had to do.  
As I moved onto the modules, I was scared by the amount of web development modules I had to learn, but Mr. Cao told me that I can come back later so I was able calm down and kept learning.  
The `fs`, `stream` and `crypto` modules were pretty easy to learn. They were a bit hard at first glance, but as I started analyzing, everything became crystal clear. However when I started looking at the `http` module I really didn't understand anything. Then I think I started to panic inside and it made the situation even worse. I even started to feel faint and so I hard to have a rest. Later I asked Mr. Cao and Fish for help. They both gave me really helpful materials that really helped me understand that chapter. Mr. Cao also told me that I don't have to hurry and that things will become clear as I start working with them. This really helped calm the panic inside me down so that I was able to move on.  
  
ES6  
-  
I did start learning a bit about ES6 today, but nothing special really happened. It was more about things I have only learned, but in more details. It doesn't seem to be hard to learn for now, but I believe I will be extremely difficult to memorize them later through the month.
