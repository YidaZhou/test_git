errors
-
- use `try{..} catch (e) {..} finally {..}`:  
if a block may have error, put in `try` block. If there is an error, then the code would be stopped and then the `catch` block would be executed with `e` as the error. In either case, finally would be executed. Except `try` the other two only have to have at least one.  
- error in js is of type `Error`.  
- we can throw an error in `try` for the `catch` block to catch. eg. `throw new Error('输入错误');`
- when caught an error, always do something with it, at least print it.  
- errors will always be passed upwards so we don't need to catch them in every corner but instead in a 'larger area'.  
- If we, for example, have a function that could be delayed (eg. setTimeOut(print, 1000);) and it contains an error. When the error comes out we could have executed out of the `try` block, in this case we cannot catch the error.  

node.js
-
- enter `node` in cmd to enter the node.js environment, ctrl+c two times to leave.  
- we can use `node --use_strict file.js` to add the `'use strict'` for us.  
- every .js file is a module and every module is independent.  
- use `module.exports = variable;` to export an variable.  eg.  
````
module.exports = {
    hello: hello,
    greet: greet
};
````
but this way you cannot give any values. 
- use `var foo = require('other_module');` to import.  
- in node.js, the global is no more `window`, but `global`.  
- `process` is an object provided by node.js representing the process.  
- `process.nextTick(..)` would execute the block in the `(..)` after the next event.  
- code like below could be used to execute the function when is about to exit.  
````
process.on('exit', function (code) {
    console.log('about to exit with code: ' + code);
});
````
- the following block could be used to see if the environment is in browser or node:  
````
if (typeof(window) === 'undefined') {
    console.log('node.js');
} else {
    console.log('browser');
}
````
- the `fs` module is used to read and write to a file. It has both sychro and asynchro methods. 
- Use `fs.readFile()` to asynchro read. Example of asynchro reading a txt file (assume we have already `var fs = require('fs');`): 
 ````
fs.readFile('sample.txt', 'utf-8', function (err, data) {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
````
- as in asynch reading, the `err` is originally `null` so, the logic of seeing if there is a problem when such is:
````
if (err) {
    // 出错了
} else {
    // 正常
}
````
- example of asynchro reading a image:  
````
fs.readFile('sample.png', function (err, data) {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
        console.log(data.length + ' bytes');
    }
});
````
reading these binary files usually return a buffer.  
- to turn a buffer into a string we can use `var text = data.toString('utf-8');` and to turn a string into a buffer `var buf = Buffer.from(text, 'utf-8');`  
- an example if synchro reading:  
````
var data = fs.readFileSync('sample.txt', 'utf-8');
console.log(data);
````
in this case, an error could be detected by the `try` and catch method. eg. 
````
try {
    var data = fs.readFileSync('sample.txt', 'utf-8');
    console.log(data);
} catch (err) {
    // 出错了
}
````
- use `fs.writeFile()` to write to a file. eg. 
````
var data = 'Hello, Node.js';
fs.writeFile('output.txt', data, function (err) {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err);
    } else {
        console.log('ok.');
    }
});
````
- `writeFile` also has a synchro version called `writeFileSync()`. eg. 
````
var data = 'Hello, Node.js';
fs.writeFileSync('output.txt', data);
````
- we can use `fs.stat()` to get information of a file. It will return a `State` object that contains the file. eg. 
````
fs.stat('sample.txt', function (err, stat) {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err);
    } else {
        console.log('isFile: ' + stat.isFile());
        console.log('isDirectory: ' + stat.isDirectory());
        if (stat.isFile()) {
            console.log('size: ' + stat.size);
            console.log('birth time: ' + stat.birthtime);
            console.log('modified time: ' + stat.mtime);
        }
    }
});
````
- again we can use synchro version of `stat()`:  
````
var  data  =  fs.statSync('sample.txt');
console.log(data.size);
````
- `stream` is used to manipulate streams, in streams:  
  - `data` means the start of the stream. This event may happen multiple times.   
  - `end` means the end of the stream.  
  - `error` means something is wrong.  
- here is an example of using `stream`:  
````
var fs = require('fs');

// 打开一个流:
var rs = fs.createReadStream('sample.txt', 'utf-8');
rs.on('data', function (chunk) {
    console.log('DATA:')
    console.log(chunk);
});
rs.on('end', function () {
    console.log('END');
});
rs.on('error', function (err) {
    console.log('ERROR: ' + err);
});
````
- after we create a `stream`, then all we need to do to write in is to use the `write()` function as much as we want and then the `end()` function. eg.  
````
var ws1 = fs.createWriteStream('output1.txt', 'utf-8');
ws1.write('使用Stream写入文本数据...\n');
ws1.write('END.');
ws1.end();
var ws2 = fs.createWriteStream('output2.txt');
ws2.write(new Buffer('使用Stream写入二进制数据...\n', 'utf-8'));
ws2.write(new Buffer('END.', 'utf-8'));
ws2.end();
````
notice we need to write buffers if we don't specify 'utf-8'. 
- all readable data are from `stream.Readable` and all writable data are from `stream.Writable`.  
- connecting a `Readable` stream to a `Writable` stream is called a `pipe`. The `Readable` stream has a `pipe()` method to do so. eg.  
````
var rs = fs.createReadStream('sample.txt');
var ws = fs.createWriteStream('copied.txt');
rs.pipe(ws);
````
When everything is done, then `ws` would be closed and `end` would happen. If we don't wan't end to happen, we can `readable.pipe(writable, { end: false });`.  
- node has the `http` module for send requests and responses between servers and browser. 
  - `request` object's props and methods are used to information of the request. 
  - `response` object's methods are used to return the response to the browser. As the response object is a writable stream, the `pipe()` method could be used on it.  
- the `url` module has a method `parse()` that takes in a string and turns it into a `Url` object. eg. `url.parse('http://user:pass@host.com:8080/path/to/file?query=string#hash')`
- the `path` module helps us find the directory, eg. `var workDir = path.resolve('.');`
- `crypto` module provides encryption.  
- `MD5` is a type of encryption in `crypto`. It makes signature (a string) for the data. An example of using MD5:  
````
const crypto = require('crypto');
const hash = crypto.createHash('md5');
hash.update('Hello, world!');
hash.update('Hello, nodejs!');
console.log(hash.digest('hex')); // 7e1977739c748beac0c0fd14fd26a544
````  
changing `'md5'` to `'sha1'` in this code would change the method of encryption from md5 to sha1. 
- `Hmac` also gives a signature to the data, but it also needs a secret key to give to it. With a different key, the same input would cause a different signature formed. So making it would be like this: `
const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'secret-key');`
- `AES` uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt. It is best to declare functions to encrypt and decrypt. eg:  
````
const crypto = require('crypto');
function aesEncrypt(data, key) {
    const cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes192', key);
    var crypted = cipher.update(data, 'utf8', 'hex');
    crypted += cipher.final('hex');
    return crypted;
}
function aesDecrypt(encrypted, key) {
    const decipher = crypto.createDecipher('aes192', key);
    var decrypted = decipher.update(encrypted, 'hex', 'utf8');
    decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');
    return decrypted;
}
````
- `crypt` also allows to use the DH method to generate one public key from two private keys. An example of applying it: 
````
const crypto = require('crypto');

// xiaoming's keys:
var ming = crypto.createDiffieHellman(512);
var ming_keys = ming.generateKeys();

var prime = ming.getPrime();
var generator = ming.getGenerator();

console.log('Prime: ' + prime.toString('hex'));
console.log('Generator: ' + generator.toString('hex'));

// xiaohong's keys:
var hong = crypto.createDiffieHellman(prime, generator);
var hong_keys = hong.generateKeys();

// exchange and generate secret:
var ming_secret = ming.computeSecret(hong_keys);
var hong_secret = hong.computeSecret(ming_keys)
````
