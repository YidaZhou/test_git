This is a report about today, yesterday, and the day before yesterday, which was a Tuesday.  
Many things were happening to me those days and I wasn't in my best state when learning. I got tired and had headaches very often, which made me really hard to concentrate.  
So starting with Tuesday, I was finishing up with the ES6 lessons and it came to promises, iterators, generator and so on, which were things I didn't know much about. I believe I had a good time learning everything and understood everything, but it is really hard to tell whether that really is true by now. It could be possible that I was too tired and things weren't really memorized well and I didn't learn much. I read up until decorators and the chapter about classes right before that was pretty simple for me.  
This is what I learned up till yesterday.  
Today, I started reading about HTML. I was in a really good mood and I believed that I wouldn't take too long as I have learned HTML before, and I was right. There wasn't much to learn, but there was a lot of things that I suppose should be memorized. I added all of them to my notes and I believe it should be good enough to come back and find the thing I want to use.  
This is what I have done for the past few days.
