\-```$ git status``` tells you the status of the current storage.  
\-```$ git diff fileName.type ``` tells the changes in the file since the last commit.  
\- after making a change in a file, in order to add it to the storage you need to first add it using ```$ git add fileName.type``` again and then you can commit it: ```$ git commit -m "comment"``` . After that, your ```$ git status ``` should be clean.  
\- ```$ git log``` could show you the history of the versions, including their commit id.  
\- the command ```$ git reset --hard commitID``` is used to go to a certain commit version. For notice, ```HEAD```means the current version, and ```HEAD^``` means the last version, so ```HEAD^^``` means the last last version and so on. If you need to restore to many versions ago, you can type in an actual number like ```HEAD~100```.  
\- Commit id in the 'future' cannot be seen in the ```$ git log``` command, but you can use ```$ git relog``` to see the history of the commands you entered and find the commit id.  
\- Changing version is very fast in git because all the versions exist at the same time, you just point the HEAD pointer to different versions.  
\- The .git folder is not part of the working directory but instead a repository which stores the stage, the master, and a HEAD pointer to the master. When you add a file, the file is added to the stage and then committed to the master.  
\- Git saves the "changes" of the files instead of the file themselves as versions.  
\- ```$ git checkout -- fileName.type``` could restore your file in the working directory back to the version you last added. This works even if you accidentally deleted the file.  
\- ```$ git reset HEAD fileName.type``` could restore your added file in the stage back to version you last committed.  
\- The command ```$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "myEmail@email.com"``` is used to generate a ssh key for a computer. Find the .pub file (which is the public key) and add it to your github account to make it your key.  
\- You can create a repository in github by clicking the "Create a new repo" button and link it with your local repository by following the hint. Usually you will need to type in ```$ git remote add origin git@server-name:path/repo-name.git``` in git bash.  
\- ```$ git push -u origin master``` should be typed for the first time you push to the origin (the github storage). This not only pushes your content to the repository, but the ```-u``` also links the content of the two repositories. Usually ```$ git push origin master``` should be enough.  
\- ```$ git clone git@server-name:path/repo-name.git``` would clone the online repository to the local directory.
